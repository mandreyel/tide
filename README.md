# Tide

Tide will eventually be a fully documented, feature-complete, fast, and easy to use BitTorrent library, written in modern C++ (14 or 17, depending on when 1.0 is launched) to serve as the underlying engine for BitTorrent applications.
For now, though usable, it is unstable. Features are added, bugs fixed, and API changes are made on a regular basis.

## NOTE

Due to API changes in Asio and thus my own fork of Boost.Beast, Tide doesn't compile currently.
